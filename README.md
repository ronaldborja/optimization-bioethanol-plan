# Optimization of a bioethanol production plant

The use of biomass for the production of alternative and renewable fuels is a global approach, as fossil fuel reserves decrease, energy demand increases, and concerns about environmental changes grow. At the national level, we are seeking ways to enhance our national security, which may include reducing our dependence on foreign oil sources. Biomass is material derived from plants or organisms that can be used in industrial processes. Various sources of biomass, such as corn, sugar beet, switchgrass, and soybeans, are being utilized and researched as potential renewable sources for alternative fuels.

Ethanol produced from biomass is currently being integrated into the fuel industry. Ethanol and gasoline blends are now being used as automotive fuel. The amount of carbon dioxide produced by ethanol combustion is significantly lower than that of gasoline.

In 2006, 83% of ethanol plants in the United States used corn as the raw material for ethanol production; however, the amount of ethanol produced per acre of corn per year is lower compared to other raw materials, such as sugar beet or sugarcane. You are tasked with optimizing an ethanol plant that uses corn as its raw material.

The design must meet the following criteria:

* One million gallons of ethanol with 95% purity must be produced.
* The sugar-to-ethanol conversion factor must never exceed 50%.
* The ethanol concentration during the fermentation process must not exceed 10% to avoid killing the yeast.
